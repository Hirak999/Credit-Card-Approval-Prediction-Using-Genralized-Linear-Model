Payment Cards like credit card, debit card e.t.c has become an integral part of our life and several banking companies, including private and government banks receives millions of credit card requests. Processing them by using human power is a time consuming task and is prone to human errors. To overcome this issue, in this project, I have worked on Credit Card Approval using Generalized Linear Models. I have used Logistic Regression to serve my purpose in this case. I have worked on this from scratch with the workflow following as Handling Missing Data, Converting the Non-Numeric Data into Numeric,Splitting the Data into Train and Test sets and Scaling the Feature values to a uniform range. Followed by Feature Selection and Fitting the logistic regression model to our data. After which the efficiency of the model is judged using confusion matrix and using GridSearchCV() I have tried to optimize it. This project is a self work of mine, which emerged from my interest of intersection of Computer Science with Finance. I have worked on this during my semester break after undertaking the course "CS771:Introduction to Machine Learning" by Piyush Rai and being highly motivated to do a project on this domain.
